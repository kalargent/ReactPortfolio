        Full Stack Web Developer with extensive experience in the software
        industry looking to utilize skills in business analysis, product and
        project management. A recent graduate of the University of
        Pennsylvania’s Coding Bootcamp, I’ve also developed competency in
        HTML/CSS, Javascript, JQuery, React.js, and databases like Mongo and
        SQL. This unique combination of skills and experience, along with my
        proven record for building, motivating and leading teams is bound to be
        an asset to any organization. I am known for my excitement and passion
        for helping people solve problems with simple intuitive software and my
        keen awareness of market and customer needs drives me to define and
        build minimum viable products (MVPs) that provide real value, opening up
        a continuous feedback loops for consistent improvement. Most recently, I
        applied my product management skills, my mastery of Agile methodologies,
        and my project management skills to help drive successful delivery of an
        innovative two-way messaging feature for an existing client while
        balancing their minimum viable product, my organizations desire to
        resell the feature to other clients, and aggressive timelines. This
        allowed my organization to meet a contractual obligation, my client to
        realize a new and innovative way of engaging their audience, and brought
        in additional revenue because the feature was built so it could apply to
        multiple industries within the organizations profile.
